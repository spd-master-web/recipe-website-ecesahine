      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients. Heat the oven to 350 F / 180 C. </li>
    <li>In a colander, rinse the rice until the water runs clear.</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, add the rice and enough water to cover it by about 1/2 inch.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Let the rice simmer gently until it's softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add 3 3/4 cups of the milk along with the sugar and vanilla extract to the rice. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it boil very gently for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, use a whisk to mix 1 cup of the milk and the cornstarch until smooth.    </li>
 <li>While stirring, gradually pour the milk-cornstarch mixture into the rice.</li>
 <li>Turn up the heat and continue stirring the pudding until scalding, about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
 <li>When the pudding thickens, continue to stir, and cook for about 2 minutes
   <li>Remove from the heat and fill small, ovenproof dessert cups, clay cups, or disposable aluminum pudding cups with the hot mixture.</li>
   <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg yolk with the remaining 3 tablespoons of milk.</li>
  <li>Using a spoon, drizzle a small amount of the egg-milk mixture into the center of each dessert cup.</li>
<li>With the back of the spoon, use a light, circular motion to swirl the egg yolk from the center to the edges so it spreads evenly over the top of each cup.</li> 
<li>Bake the pudding cups until the tops are nicely browned, about 20 minutes.</li> 
<li>Let the cups cool at room temperature and then refrigerate for several hours before serving. Enjoy.</li>
